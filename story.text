I'm in my last high school days.
I'm very excited.
I went to Pete's Pizza for lunch.
I went to every class period today.
Then, I'm going to go home. 
Do homework.
I'm going shopping.
Then I'm going back home.
Then I'm going to get some well needed sleep.
Then I'm going to wake up and get some hearty, tasty breakfast.
